''' 
a function is a great way to store a block of code for re use
this makes your software much cleaner
Note: sometimes you may hear the word function and method interchangeably
'''

firstName = 'Jon'
lastName = 'Doe'

# use def to create a function
def sayHello():
  print("Hello", firstName, lastName, "!")

# remeber after you create a function you must CALL it
sayHello()
